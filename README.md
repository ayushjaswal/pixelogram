# Pixelogram
It's nothing special

It's just a simple script to give your photoes a pixelated look, giving your pictures the old vintage game asthetic vibes.  
I don't know who will use it, but hey go ahead below are some important things that might help you on the go!

### How to use the script üßë‚Äçüíª
- Clone the project (nothing fancy here) 
- simply run `python former.py`. It will run the former module where you will be asked to provide the path of the image. Sorry there isn't a GUI for this :)
- In case you want to change the look of the image you can change pixel_factor and threshold value
  - pixel_factor: The amount by which your image will pixelate. More of it means more pixelated (i.e less pixels)
  - threshold: it will change the way the image forms, like the colors and light. You can tweak the values to see the look. lower threshold means brighter image.


I've attached some samples just so you can see how the image processing works.

### Future Aspects üöÄ
No future aspects as of now, I may add some things here and there but idk -hopefully this is where I stop, it's not a rocket science anyway!
